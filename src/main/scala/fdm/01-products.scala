 *
 * Tuples come with lots of free functionality, including constructors, deconstructors, equality
 * and hash code, string representation for debugging, and a copy method.
 *
 * The elements of a tuple are accessed "by index". For example, `("a", 1)._1` retrieves the first
 * element of the tuple, which is the string `"a"`.
 *
 * Tuples are immutable: once constructed, they cannot change. However, there are simple ways to
 * create a new tuple from an existing tuple, in which some element has been "changed".
 *
 * Scala supports tuples of any "arity": that is, tuples can have as many elements as necessary.
 *
 * Tuples are examples of "anonymous products": they are types formed using "product composition"
 * of other types.
